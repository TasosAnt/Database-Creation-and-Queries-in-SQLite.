# Database-Creation-and-Queries-in-SQLite.
ER, DB creation in SQLite and queries completion 

The general tasks of the given project, were to create a database and submit some queries.  Firstly I had to design an ER diagram, 
where I had to identify the entities and the relationships amongst them. Secondly, with the help of the DBDesigner Fork tool, I converted the ER into a Relational Model, 
and afterwards I exported the code in SQLite. After creating the database, I inserted some indicative data in order to  answer the required queries.
